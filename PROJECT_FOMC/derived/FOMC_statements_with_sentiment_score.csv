however, the committee expects the pace of recovery to pick up over coming quarters and the unemployment rate to resume its gradual decline toward levels that the committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate.      inflation has moved up recently, but the committee anticipates that inflation will subside to levels at or below those consistent with the committee's dual mandate as the effects of past energy and other commodity price increases dissipate.  however, the committee will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations. to promote the ongoing economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with its mandate, the committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent.  the committee continues to anticipate that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period.  the committee will complete its purchases of $600 billion of longer-term treasury securities by the end of this month and will maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its securities holdings.  the committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate. the committee will monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will act as needed to best foster maximum employment and price stability. voting for the fomc monetary policy action were: ben s. bernanke, chairman;

56,2013-09-18,2013,Bernanke,"information received since the federal open market committee met in july suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace. some indicators of labor market conditions have shown further improvement in recent months, but the unemployment rate remains elevated. household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has been strengthening, but mortgage rates have risen further and fiscal policy is restraining economic growth. apart from fluctuations due to changes in energy prices, inflation has been running below the committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. the committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will pick up from its recent pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. the committee sees the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished, on net, since last fall, but the tightening of financial conditions observed in recent months, if sustained, could slow the pace of improvement in the economy and labor market. the committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, but it anticipates that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term. taking into account the extent of federal fiscal retrenchment, the committee sees the improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions since it began its asset purchase program a year ago as consistent with growing underlying strength in the broader economy. however, the committee decided to await more evidence that progress will be sustained before adjusting the pace of its purchases. accordingly, the committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month. the committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing treasury securities at auction. taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the committee's dual mandate. the committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. in judging when to moderate the pace of asset purchases, the committee will, at its coming meetings, assess whether incoming information continues to support the committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective. asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the committee's economic outlook as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases. to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. in particular, the committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. in determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. when the committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. voting for the fomc monetary policy action were: ben s. bernanke, chairman;

58,2013-12-18,2013,Bernanke,"information received since the federal open market committee met in october indicates that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace. labor market conditions have shown further improvement; the unemployment rate has declined but remains elevated. household spending and business fixed investment advanced, while the recovery in the housing sector slowed somewhat in recent months. fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint may be diminishing. inflation has been running below the committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. the committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will pick up from its recent pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. the committee sees the risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having become more nearly balanced. the committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, and it is monitoring inflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term. taking into account the extent of federal fiscal retrenchment since the inception of its current asset purchase program, the committee sees the improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions over that period as consistent with growing underlying strength in the broader economy. in light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions, the committee decided to modestly reduce the pace of its asset purchases. beginning in january, the committee will add to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $35 billion per month rather than $40 billion per month, and will add to its holdings of longer-term treasury securities at a pace of $40 billion per month rather than $45 billion per month. the committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing treasury securities at auction. the committee's sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the committee's dual mandate. the committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. if incoming information broadly supports the committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings. however, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases. to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. the committee also reaffirmed its expectation that the current exceptionally low target range for the federal funds rate of 0 to 1/4 percent will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. in determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. the committee now anticipates, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6-1/2 percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal. when the committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. voting for the fomc monetary policy action

60,2014-03-19,2014,Yellen,"information received since the federal open market committee met in january indicates that growth in economic activity slowed during the winter months, in part reflecting adverse weather conditions. labor market indicators were mixed but on balance showed further improvement. the unemployment rate, however, remains elevated. household spending and business fixed investment continued to advance, while the recovery in the housing sector remained slow. fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint is diminishing. inflation has been running below the committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. the committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will continue to improve gradually, moving toward those the committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. the committee sees the risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as nearly balanced. the committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, and it is monitoring inflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term. the committee currently judges that there is sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing improvement in labor market conditions. in light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program, the committee decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases. beginning in april, the committee will add to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $25 billion per month rather than $30 billion per month, and will add to its holdings of longer-term treasury securities at a pace of $30 billion per month rather than $35 billion per month. the committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of

committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings. however, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases. to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate. in determining how long to maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. this assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. the committee continues to anticipate, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. when the committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of

61,2014-04-30,2014,Yellen,"information received since the federal open market committee met in march indicates that growth in economic activity has picked up recently, after having slowed sharply during the winter in part because of adverse weather conditions. labor market indicators were mixed but on balance showed further improvement. the unemployment rate, however, remains elevated. household spending appears to be rising more quickly. business fixed investment edged down, while the recovery in the housing sector remained slow. fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint is diminishing. inflation has been running below the committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. the committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will continue to improve gradually, moving toward those the committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. the committee sees the risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as nearly balanced. the committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, and it is monitoring inflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term. the committee currently judges that there is sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing improvement in labor market conditions. in light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program, the committee decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases. beginning in may, the committee will add to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $20 billion per month rather than $25 billion per month, and will add to its holdings of longer-term treasury securities at a pace of $25 billion per month rather than $30 billion per month. the committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing treasury securities at auction. the committee's sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the committee's dual mandate. the committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. if incoming information broadly supports the committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings. however, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases. to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate. in determining how long to maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. this assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. the committee continues to anticipate, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. when the committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. the committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the committee views as normal in the longer run. voting for the fomc

survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. the committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators and inflation moving toward levels the committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. the committee sees the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced. although inflation in the near term will likely be held down by lower energy prices and other factors, the committee judges that the likelihood of inflation running persistently below 2 percent has diminished somewhat since early this year. the committee judges that there has been a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market since the inception of its current asset purchase program. moreover, the committee continues to see sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing progress toward maximum employment in a context of price stability. accordingly, the committee decided to conclude its asset purchase program this month. the committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing treasury securities at auction. this policy, by keeping the committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions. to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate. in determining how long to maintain this target range, the committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. this assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. the committee anticipates, based on its current assessment, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time following the end of its asset purchase program this month, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. however, if incoming information indicates faster progress toward the committee's employment and inflation objectives than the committee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate are likely to occur sooner than currently anticipated. conversely, if progress proves slower than expected, then increases in the target range are likely to occur later than currently anticipated. when the committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. the committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the committee views as normal in the longer run. voting for the fomc monetary policy action were: janet l. yellen, chair;

however, net exports have been soft. a range of recent labor market indicators, including ongoing job gains and declining unemployment, shows further improvement and confirms that underutilization of labor resources has diminished appreciably since early this year. inflation has continued to run below the committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; some survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have edged down. consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. the committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will continue to expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen. overall, taking into account domestic and international developments, the committee sees the risks to the outlook for both economic activity and the labor market as balanced. inflation is expected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. the committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely. the committee judges that there has been considerable improvement in labor market conditions this year, and it is reasonably confident that inflation will rise, over the medium term, to its 2 percent objective. given the economic outlook, and recognizing the time it takes for policy actions to affect future economic outcomes, the committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1/4 to 1/2 percent. the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative after this increase, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation. in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. this assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. in light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal. the committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. however, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. the committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way. this policy, by keeping the committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions. voting for the fomc monetary policy action were: janet l. yellen, chair;

78,2016-06-15,2016,Yellen,"information received since the federal open market committee met in april indicates that the pace of improvement in the labor market has slowed while growth in economic activity appears to have picked up. although the unemployment rate has declined, job gains have diminished. growth in household spending has strengthened. since the beginning of the year, the housing sector has continued to improve and the drag from net exports appears to have lessened, but business fixed investment has been soft. inflation has continued to run below the committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. market-based measures of inflation compensation declined; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months. consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. the committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will strengthen. inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. the committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments. against this backdrop, the committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1/4 to 1/2 percent. the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation. in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. this assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. in light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal. the committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. however, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. the committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way. this policy, by keeping the committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions. voting for the fomc monetary policy action were: janet l. yellen, chair;
